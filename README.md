# criminal-record-app

To get started cd criminal-record-check

Then run 
```bash
yarn  
```

# How to get the app runnning
To get the app running we need to run both the app and the server to run locally. 

# To start the app

```bash
yarn start 
```
to start the app it will open up in localhost:3000

    

# To start the server

```bash
cd server
node index.js
```

This should spin up your api server on localhost:8000 and to have a look at the api raw data go to localhost:8000/api/records to check all records


# Things i could have done better

- Add in styled components to use them across
- Have more code coverage, add in more tests 
- Have a better folder structure
